# parser_can
This is simple project for debug some code for ARM9 processor.
Fisrt off all it is debug circle buffer for collect bytes from another processor via can interface (circle_buffer.cpp).
Secondly it is for debug algoritm for parsing message (parser_can.cpp)
On ARM9 we have only C99 (more exactly -std=gnu99).
